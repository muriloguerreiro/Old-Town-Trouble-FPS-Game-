#### Objective
Develop a simple game, taking advantage of the knowledge acquired during the Computer Graphics discipline and additional knowledge through tutorials in the
YouTube and forums on the Unity platform.

#### Development
The game was developed in Unity 3D using C# language to write the scripts. The scenario and elements were totally modeled in 3DS Max.
A wild west themed first-person shooter was developed where the player plays the role of a sheriff who is trying to protect his city from the bandits, who robbed the city bank.
The sheriff must kill them, in the shortest possible time, to save the civilians. If a civilian dies, the player loses immediately.

#### Mechanisms
Some of the character's mechanisms implemented are walking, jumping and shooting. 
Also included in the game is a menu and a pause screen with options to start a new game, return and quit.
When the game is over, a win or lose screen appears.
